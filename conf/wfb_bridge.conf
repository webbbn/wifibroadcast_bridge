# Generic transmission patters for various device types.

# interface (required) - The wifi device that will be used as a relay

# txpower - The transmission power level in mbm
# mcs - Use mcs transmission rates (if supported) if set to 1
# stbc - Use space-time block coding (if supported) if set to 1
# ldpc - Use low-density parity-check code (if supported) if set to 1

# Specific configuration of individual devices.
# The fields are the same as the generic transmission parameters with the addition
# of the optional "type" field and "mode" field:
#
# type - One of (transmitter, receiver, transceiver, relay) defined as:
#
#   tranmitter - The devices used for WFB transmission (currently only one supported)
#   receiver - The devices used as a receive only device (currently only one supported)
#   transceiver - The devices used for both transmission and reception (currently only one supported)
#   relay - All received packets will be re-transmitted on these devices (currently only one supported)
#   ignore - These devices will not be configured at all
#
# The mode field can be configured to override the global mode (air/ground), which can be useful for
# e.g. relay mode, etc

# UDP interface links
#
# The definition of all the UDP to UDP links across the wifi interface
#
# Note: the port/host configuration value should contain a port number and an optional list
#   of comma separated hosts separated from the port number with a colon. The port number is
#   the port that packets will be recieved on (ether on the local side or remote side depending
#   on the specific configuration type) and the hosts that the packets should be relayed to
#   on the opposite side of the link. If no hosts are specified then localhost (127.0.0.1) is assumed.
#
# Supported configuration values:
#
# name - A textual name for the link
# port - A unique number (1-64) used to route the link
# air - The receive port number on the air side and optional list of hosts to send to on the ground side
# ground - The receive port number on the ground side and optional list of hosts to send to on the air side
# archive_indir - Archive the entire stream received from UDP to a file in the directory specified
# archive_outdir - Archive the entire stream received over wifi to a file in the directory specified
# blocksize - The maximum size of a data block supported.
# blocks - The number of data blocks in an FEC sequence
# fec - The number of FEC blocks in an FEC sequence
# priority - The priority order to send packets over the wifi link (not yet implemented)
# datarate - The data rate (as specified above) to send this link over (if the driver supports variable rates)
