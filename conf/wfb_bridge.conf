#   receiver - The devices used as a receive only device (currently only one supported)
#   transceiver - The devices used for both transmission and reception (currently only one supported)
#   relay - All received packets will be re-transmitted on these devices (currently only one supported)
#   ignore - These devices will not be configured at all

# The WFB bridge interface implements a standard network interafce to the host that is routed over
# a point-to-point wifi broadcast link to another host. Both sides create a TUN interface that
# can be treated as a traditional network interface connecting the two sides of the link.
#
# By default, all traffic on the interface will be routed over the WFB link using the default parameters
# specified in the "global" section. The section below can be used to secify links that should be treated
# different from the normal traffic.
#
# The distinction is made using the destination port number of the packet that is being transmitted.
# If the destination port number is equal to one of the ports listed below, the packet will be transmitted
# over the channel associated with that port number.
#
# Supported configuration values:
#
# name - A textual name for the link
# port - A unique number (1-16) used to route the link
# ip_port - All packets destined to this port will be routed over the WFB link with these parameters.
# blocks - The number of data blocks in an FEC sequence
# fec - The number of FEC blocks in an FEC sequence
# type - The frame type to use (data, short, rts)
# priority - The priority order to send packets over the wifi link (not yet implemented)
# datarate - The data rate (as specified above) to send this link over (if the driver supports variable rates)
