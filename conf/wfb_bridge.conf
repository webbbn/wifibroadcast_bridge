# Specific configuration of individual devices.

# type - One of (transmitter, receiver, transceiver, relay) defined as:
#
#   tranmitter - The devices used for WFB transmission (currently only one supported)
#   receiver - The devices used as a receive only device (currently only one supported)
#   transceiver - The devices used for both transmission and reception (currently only one supported)
#   relay - All received packets will be re-transmitted on these devices (currently only one supported)
#   ignore - These devices will not be configured at all
#
# The mode field can be configured to override the global mode (air/ground), which can be useful for
# e.g. relay mode, etc

# UDP interface links
#
# The definition of all the UDP to UDP links across the wifi interface
#
# Supported configuration values:
#
# name - A textual name for the link
# direction - (up/down) Is this data going up (ground to air) or down (air to ground)
# port - A unique number (1-64) used to route the link
# inport - The UDP receive port on the near side
# outports - A comma separated list of host:port to send UDP packets to on the far end
# archive_indir - Archive the entire stream received from UDP to a file in the directory specified
# archive_outdir - Archive the entire stream received over wifi to a file in the directory specified
# blocksize - The maximum size of a data block supported.
# blocks - The number of data blocks in an FEC sequence
# fec - The number of FEC blocks in an FEC sequence
# priority - The priority order to send packets over the wifi link (not yet implemented)
# datarate - The data rate (as specified above) to send this link over (if the driver supports variable rates)
